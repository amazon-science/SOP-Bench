<img width="613" height="406" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db61aa12-b64e-47e6-b71d-01aa80c3124e" />

## Overview
**SOP-Bench** is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents on complex, multi-step Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that are fundamental to industrial automation. Built from 2,000+ tasks across 12 industrial domains (healthcare, logistics, finance, content moderation, etc.), SOP-Bench addresses the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world procedural complexity.

### Key Features
🏭 **Human Expert-Authored SOPs**: Authentic procedures crafted by domain experts reflecting real-world complexity
🤖 **Human-AI Collaborative Framework**: AI-generated artifacts (tools, APIs, datasets) with human validation
📊 **Executable Interfaces**: Ground-truth outputs enabling reproducible evaluation
🔧 **Two Agent Architectures**: Function-Calling (FC) and ReAct agents for systematic comparison
📈 **11 Frontier Models Evaluated**: Comprehensive benchmarking across Claude, GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek families
